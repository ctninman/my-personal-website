    <h2 id="path_one">Path 1 - Classical Guitarist</h2>

      <p id="guitar_one" class="guitar_p">
        Chris's journey began with music, after it began with baseball, or more accurately, anything that was, or resembled, a sport.
        His musical journey began with the purchase of his first three album's: <strong>Green Day</strong>'s <em>Dookie</em>,
        <strong>Mariah Carey</strong>'s <em>Daydream</em>, and the <em>Waiting to Exhale</em> soundtrack. By some twist of fater, a
        love for a nu-metal song that he refuses to admit he ever liked led him to purchase the <em>Ozzfest Live</em> VHS tape, and
        the gates of heavy metal were opened. Performances by <strong>Slayer</strong>, <strong>Sepultura</strong>, and 
        <strong>Neurosis</strong>inspired Chris to want to learn to play guitar, coupled with a burning desire to become better at
        everything than his best friend, who had started playing a year earlier.
    </p>
    
    <p id="guitar_two" class="guitar_p">
        As a long-haired, slightly smelly teenager, Chris had little direction as to where to go in life. There was only thing
        for certain, his best friend now had a long neck and six strings. So as not to disown his parents, who had gone to great
        lengths to save for his college education, Chris knew a four-year stint at a Wisconsin state university was in the cards.
        Having no other passion than making noise with his guitar, he searched for a heavy metal college guitar program, but ended
        up settling on classical guitar.

    <h2 id="path_two">Path 2 - Preschool Assistant Teacher</h2>

    <p id="prek_one" class="prek_p">
       After finishing up four years of intense study of music theory and classical guitar performance, mixed in with a healthy
       dose of ping-pong, Chris gave the final performance of his college career at his senior recital. To prevent the auditorium
       from being too eerily silent, Chris invited a few friends, and his parents invited everyone they knew to the event.
    </p>

    <p id="prek_two" class="prek_p">
       One of the concert attendees was a long-time family friend, who happened to be a preschool teacher. She asked Chris what he
       planned to do after graduating, to which he replied as most music performance majors do, <strong>"Beats me?"</strong> That
       answer somehow instilled in her a confidence to ask him to apply to be an assistant teacher in her classroom and help shape
       the minds of the future generation. And thus he did for five years, for better or for worse.

    <h2 id="path-three">Path 3 - Manny</h2>

    <p id="manny_one" class="manny_p">
       Chris's go-getter sister, who had been trying to get him to leave his Madison, Wisconsin comfort zone and come visit her in
       Brooklyn for years, was finally successful in the summer of 2011. Chris spent his summer sleeping on her couch after spending
       his days out and about, so as not to be too much of an unwelcome guest. During his countless hours walking around Brooklyn
       that summer, he met the love of his life while playing volleyball. They spent the summer playing more volleyball, yoga, and
       whatever other cheap thing they could find to do. The love of his life then returned to Italy for the second half of the 
       summer, with the possibility of never returning. 
    </p>

    <p id="manny_two" class="manny_p">
       As the end of the summer drew near, Chris had to make a decision whether to return to Wisconsin or stay in Brooklyn. He thus
       declared that if a job was secured, he would stay in Brooklyn and see if his future wife would return. If no job was found,
       he'd return to Wisconsin and continue to work at the preschool. Chris's sister knew some people who were looking for a new 
       nanny. Chris met them and their daughter, and ended up spending the next several years exploring NYC with his amazing 2-year-
       old buddy. Well, I guess this isn't Simpsons world, so she wasn't two for all of those several years. And did the love of
       Chris's life return from Italy? Of course, who could say no to those pecs? Oh wait, those aren't mine. Ummm, yes she did.

    <h2 id="path_four">Path 4 - Third Grade Teacher</h2>

    <p id="teacher_one" class="teacher_p">
        While continuing to be one of Brooklyn's trendy mannies, Chris got married to the love of his life, and she convinced him return
        to get his Master's Degree in childhood education. After graduating, Chris was a substitute teacher in Brooklyn for a year, 
        getting a front row seat to the vastly different experiences across ages and school experiences. He became a third grade teacher,
        experiencing first-hand how hard teachers work, and how underpaid and underappreciated they are. He will never say a bad word to
        any of his son's teachers.
    </p>
    
    <p id="teacher_two" class="teacher_p">
        When the pandemic hit and school was forced to go online, Chris was one of the few teachers at his school who found the new
        format exciting and invigorating. As someone who is undoubtedly introverted, teaching was an extra stressful situation, and
        online teaching allowed more time to plan engaging material, without as much time speaking in front of a group. He took charge
        in creating a website for the school to connect with students and families from the virtual world. He joined the tech commmittee
        and taught workshops to other teachers on how to incorporate technology into teaching. He had a classroom of third graders who
        were more technologically proficiend than 95% of the teachers. The passion he had to create educational tech material, combined
        with many success stories he heard from others who had gone to coding bootcamps, led him to decide it was time to pursue a
        change to software engineering.
