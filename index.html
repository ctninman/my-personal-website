    <h2>Classical Guitarist</h2>

      <p>
        Chris's musical journey began with the purchase of his first three album's: <strong>Green Day</strong>'s <em>Dookie</em>,
        <strong>Mariah Carey</strong>'s <em>Daydream</em>, and the <em>Waiting to Exhale</em> soundtrack. A love for the song
        <em>Loco</em> by <strong>Coal Chamber</strong> led him to purchase the <em>Ozzfest Live</em> VHS tape, and the gates of
        heavy metal were opened. Performances by <strong>Slayer</strong>, <strong>Sepultura</strong>, and <strong>Neurosis</strong>
        inspired Chris to want to learn to play guitar, coupled with a burning desire to become better at everything than his best
        friend, who had started playing a year earlier.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        As a long-haired, slightly smelly teenager, Chris had little direction as to where to go in life. There was only thing
        for certain, his best friend now had a long neck and six strings. So as not to disown his parents, who had gone to great
        lengths to save for his college education, Chris knew a four-year stint at a Wisconsin state university was in the cards.
        Having no other passion than making noise with his guitar, he searched for a heavy metal college guitar program, but ended
        up settling on classical guitar.

    <h2>Preschool Assistant Teacher</h2>

    <p>
       After finishing up four years of intense study of music theory and classical guitar performance, mixed in with a healthy
       dose of ping-pong, Chris gave the final performance of his college career at his senior recital. To prevent the auditorium
       from being too eerily silent, Chris invited a few friends, and his parents invited everyone they knew to the event.
    </p>

    <p>
       One of the concert attendees was a long-time family friend, who happened to be a preschool teacher. She asked Chris what he
       planned to do after graduating, to which he replied as most music performance majors do, <strong>"Beats me?"</strong> That
       answer somehow instilled in her a confidence to ask him to apply to be an assistant teacher in her classroom and help shape
       the minds of the future generation.

    <h2>Manny</h2>

    <p>
       Chris's go-getter sister, who had been trying to get him to leave his Madison, Wisconsin comfort zone and come visit her in
       Brooklyn for years, was finally successful in the summer of 2011. Chris spent his summer sleeping on her couch after spending
       his days out and about, so as not to be too much of an unwelcome guest. During his countless hours walking around Brooklyn
       that summer, he met the love of his life while playing volleyball. They spent the summer playing more volleyball, yoga, and
       whatever other cheap thing they could find to do. The love of his life then returned to Italy for the second half of the 
       summer, with the possibility of never returning. 
    </p>

    <p>
       As the end of the summer drew near, Chris had to make a decision whether to return to Wisconsin or stay in Brooklyn. It was thus
       declared that if a job was secured, he would stay in Brooklyn and see if his future wife would return. If no job was found,
       he'd return to Wisconsin and continue to work at the preschool. Chris's sister spent some time working in a wine shop, and
       the owners were looking for a new nanny. Chris met them and their daughter, and ended up spending the next several years
       learning how young minds develop with his new friend, age two when they met.
