    <h2>Classical Guitarist</h2>

      <p>
        Chris's musical journey began with the purchase of his first three album's: <strong>Green Day</strong>'s <em>Dookie</em>,
        <strong>Mariah Carey</strong>'s <em>Daydream</em>, and the <em>Waiting to Exhale</em> soundtrack. A love for the song
        <em>Loco</em> by <strong>Coal Chamber</strong> led him to purchase the <em>Ozzfest Live</em> VHS tape, and the gates of
        heavy metal were opened. Performances by <strong>Slayer</strong>, <strong>Sepultura</strong>, and <strong>Neurosis</strong>
        inspired Chris to want to learn to play guitar, coupled with a burning desire to become better at everything than his best
        friend, who had started playing a year earlier.

        As a long-haired, slightly smelly teenager, Chris had little direction as to where to go in life. There was only thing
        for certain, his best friend now had a long neck and six strings. So as not to disown his parents, who had gone to great
        lengths to save for his college education, Chris knew a four-year stint at a Wisconsin state university was in the cards.
        Having no other passion than making noise with his guitar, he searched for a heavy metal college guitar program, but ended
        up settling on classical guitar.
